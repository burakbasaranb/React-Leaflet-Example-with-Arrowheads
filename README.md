# react-leaflet with arrowheads example

This is an example code that demonstrates the usage of the `react-leaflet` library along with the `arrowheads` plugin. The code is designed to work with both Yandex and Google maps.

## Description

This code showcases how to integrate `react-leaflet` with the `arrowheads` library, allowing you to display arrowheads on your maps. The `react-leaflet` library provides a React wrapper for Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps. The `arrowheads` plugin extends `react-leaflet` by adding support for arrowheads on polylines.

The code includes the necessary dependencies and imports, as well as a basic setup for the map component. It demonstrates how to create a map instance, set the initial view, and add a tile layer from either Yandex or Google maps.

Additionally, the code shows how to create a polyline and apply arrowheads to it using the `arrowheads` plugin. You can customize the appearance of the arrowheads by modifying the provided options, such as the arrow size, color, and position.

## Usage

To use this code, make sure you have `react-leaflet` and `arrowheads` installed in your project. You can then copy the code and modify it according to your needs. Follow the comments in the code to understand each step and customize the map and arrowhead properties.

Please note that you need to provide your own API keys for Yandex and Google maps in order to display the map tiles. Refer to the official documentation of the respective providers to obtain the API keys and configure them in the code.
