# react-leaflet with arrowheads example

This is an example code that demonstrates the usage of the `react-leaflet` library along with the `arrowheads` plugin. The code is designed to work with both Yandex and Google maps.

## Description

This code showcases how to integrate `react-leaflet` with the `arrowheads` library, allowing you to display arrowheads on your maps. The `react-leaflet` library provides a React wrapper for Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps. The `arrowheads` plugin extends `react-leaflet` by adding support for arrowheads on polylines.

The code includes the necessary dependencies and imports, as well as a basic setup for the map component. It demonstrates how to create a map instance, set the initial view, and add a tile layer from either Yandex or Google maps.

Additionally, the code shows how to create a polyline and apply arrowheads to it using the `arrowheads` plugin. You can customize the appearance of the arrowheads by modifying the provided options, such as the arrow size, color, and position.

## Usage

To use this code, make sure you have `react-leaflet` and `arrowheads` installed in your project. You can then copy the code and modify it according to your needs. Follow the comments in the code to understand each step and customize the map and arrowhead properties.

Please note that you need to provide your own API keys for Yandex and Google maps in order to display the map tiles. Refer to the official documentation of the respective providers to obtain the API keys and configure them in the code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
